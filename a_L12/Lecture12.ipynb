    "So far, we are averaging out our measures. This is important for understanding stability of climate processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some processes are seasonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temperature Variations**: As the Earth orbits the sun, its axial tilt causes different regions to receive varying amounts of solar radiation at different times of the year. \n",
    "    + This results in seasonal temperature changes, such as warmer summers and colder winters in temperate regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precipitation Patterns**: Many areas experience seasonal changes in precipitation.\n",
    "    + Monsoon climates in South Asia and parts of Africa have distinct wet and dry seasons driven by wind patterns that change with the seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Plant Phenology**: The life cycles of plants, including budding, flowering, fruiting, and shedding leaves, often follow seasonal patterns that respond to changes in temperature and daylight hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Animal Behavior**: Many animals exhibit seasonal behaviors such as migration, hibernation, and breeding, which are synchronized with environmental conditions favorable for survival or reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Oceanic Processes**: Seasonal changes also affect ocean currents and marine ecosystems. \n",
    "    + Seasonal wind patterns can drive upwelling processes that bring nutrients to the ocean surface, supporting high biological productivity during certain times of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding seasonal processes is crucial for predicting and managing various aspects of human activity, including agriculture, water resource management, and preparation for weather-related disasters."

    "\n",
    "**Location:** The ITCZ is not a fixed location. Its position varies seasonally, shifting north or south with the sun's zenith, which is most directly overhead at the equator during the equinoxes and moves toward the Tropic of Cancer in June and the Tropic of Capricorn in December.\n",

    "**Weather Patterns:** The convergence of northern and southern hemisphere trade winds leads to rising warm air that results in cloud formation and precipitation. This makes the ITCZ a major belt of rainfall, which is particularly pronounced over oceans."

    "- The **combine** step merges the results of these operations into an output xarray Dataset or DataArray.\n",

    "We are going to use `groupby` to remove the seasonal cycle (\"climatology\") from our dataset, which will allow us to better observe long-term trends in the data. \n",
